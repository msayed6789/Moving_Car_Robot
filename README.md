# Moving_Car_Robot
The moving car project is designed to make the car travel in a rectangular shape when the start button is pressed, adjusting its speed based on its location within the rectangle. Pressing the stop button will halt the car's movement.

<br>

# System Operation:
## Start button is pressed:-
### 1) The car will move forward along the longer side for 3 seconds at 50% of its speed, and the Forward LED will illuminate.
### 2) The car will come to a halt for 0.5 seconds, and the Stop LED will be illuminated.
### 3) The car will rotate 90 degrees clockwise over 2 seconds.
### 4) The car will pause for 0.5 seconds, with the Stop LED on.
### 5) The car will move forward along the shorter side for 2 seconds at 30% of its speed, and the Forward_Short LED will be illuminated.
### 6) The car will stop, and the Stop LED will be lit.
### 7) The car will rotate 90 degrees clockwise over 2 seconds.
### 8) The system will repeat these steps indefinitely.

## Stop button is pressed:-
### The car will stop.
